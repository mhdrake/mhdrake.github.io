Wage Differentials and the Price of Workplace Flexibility (with Neil Thakral and Linh T&ocirc;)
<details>
<summary open> Abstract </summary>
<br>
This paper studies the interplay between how much workers value workplace flexibility, whether they have such amenities, and how the presence of amenities affects their wages. To overcome the challenge of eliciting quantitative measures of willingness to pay (WTP) at the individual level, we propose the use of dynamic choice experiments, a method which we call the Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE). We implement this method to collect data on the joint distribution of wages, work arrangements, and WTP for different forms of flexibility. We then introduce and estimate a model in which workers may face different prices for job amenities depending on their productivity, extending the Rosen (1986) model of compensating differentials. The model captures key patterns in the data, including (i) the relationship between wages and having amenities, (ii) inequality in workplace amenities across the earnings distribution even when workers value these amenities similarly, and (iii) the tradeoffs across different forms of flexibility. We use the estimates to explore the welfare consequences of workers facing different amenity prices.

Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiments (with Fernando Payr&oacute;, Neil Thakral, and Linh T&ocirc;)
<details>
<summary open> Abstract </summary>
<br>
We propose the use of dynamic choice experiments to efficiently elicit preferences, a method which we call the Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE). BACE improves upon existing discrete choice experiments which are widely used to elicit preferences both in hypothetical and incentivized settings. We show conditions under which BACE achieves convergence, and that BACE can significantly improve convergence rates relative to methods with randomly generated choices as well as those using optimal static designs. We address computational challenges in implementing BACE in practice by using Bayesian Monte Carlo techniques. The separation between a front-end survey interface and a back-end computational server allows the BACE package to be portable for research designs in a wide range of settings. Beyond efficiency gains, BACE addresses a bias in estimating population-level average preference parameters stemming from using combined data across individuals when individuals differ in their tendency to be inconsistent in their choices. We describe how to use BACE in applications.
