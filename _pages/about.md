About Me
--------
Welcome!

Iâ€™m a PhD economist and full-stack data scientist with a focus on causal inference, experimental design, and developing production-ready software tools. At Capital One, I build forecasting models and applications that support cash logistics and operational strategy. Previously, I worked as an economist at the EEOC, where I served as an expert in employment discrimination cases. I earned my PhD in Economics from Boston University in 2023, where my research focused on Labor, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics. In recent work, I have used adaptive survey experiments to understand how people value job amenities and different public policies.
