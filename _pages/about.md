About Me
--------
Welcome! I am an economist working for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

My research interests include Behavioral & Experimental Economics, Labor Economics, and Public Economics. In recent work, I have used adaptive survey experiments to understand how people value job amenities and different public policies. I am also interested in understanding how prior actions influence the way individuals seek out information and update beliefs.
