About Me
--------
Welcome! I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University. My research interests include Behavioral, Labor, Public, and Experimental Economics. In recent work, I have used adaptive survey experiments to understand how people value job amenities and different public policies.

You can download my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2enbx4f509t5np4/MDrake_CV.pdf?dl=0).
