About Me
--------
Welcome! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University. My research interests include Behavioral & Experimental Economics, Labor Economics, and Public Economics. In recent work, I have used adaptive survey experiments to understand how people value job amenities and different public policies. I am also interested in understanding how prior actions influence the way individuals seek out information and update beliefs.
